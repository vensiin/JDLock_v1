This is a python project I am working on; JDLock. This is a project password manager I made for fun and also because I needed one. 
The app is pretty much done, i just have to play with encryption so i deploy it without worry.
As of right now you can still use it just fine but i would recommend you use it only at home. i dont want you to be on a public network while using this and you get your data stolen lmao
